    "# Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\" regression, is a linear regression technique \n",
    "# used in statistics and machine learning. It is a regularization method that is primarily employed for feature selection and\n",
    "# the prevention of overfitting in regression models. Here's how it differs from other regression techniques, particularly from\n",
    "# ordinary linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Regularization:\n",
    "# Lasso Regression introduces a regularization term (L1 regularization) into the linear regression model. This regularization\n",
    "# term penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients, forcing some of them to be exactly zero. In contrast, ordinary linear\n",
    "# regression does not incorporate any regularization, and the coefficients can take any value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Feature Selection:\n",
    "# One of the main advantages of Lasso Regression is its ability to perform feature selection automatically. By driving some \n",
    "# coefficient values to zero, Lasso effectively removes irrelevant or less important features from the model. This can lead \n",
    "# to simpler and more interpretable models, making it particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Sparsity:\n",
    "# Lasso tends to produce sparse models, meaning it results in models with a subset of the most important features having \n",
    "# non-zero coefficients. This is in contrast to ridge regression, which uses L2 regularization and tends to shrink all \n",
    "# coefficients towards zero but rarely exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Trade-off:\n",
    "# Lasso introduces a trade-off between the fit to the data and the complexity of the model. By penalizing the absolute values \n",
    "# of coefficients, it helps prevent overfitting, which can be a problem in ordinary linear regression, especially when the \n",
    "# number of features is high compared to the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Loss Function:\n",
    "# In Lasso Regression, the loss function is a combination of the mean squared error (MSE) and the L1 regularization term. The\n",
    "# optimization process aims to minimize this combined loss. In contrast, ordinary linear regression minimizes only the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Applications:\n",
    "# Lasso Regression is particularly well-suited for situations where you suspect that many of your features are irrelevant or\n",
    "# redundant, or when you want to build a simpler and more interpretable model. It is commonly used in variable selection,\n",

    "\n",
    "# 3.Improved Model Generalization:Selecting a smaller set of features can reduce the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs\n",

    "# Just like in ordinary linear regression, the magnitude (size) of a coefficient in Lasso Regression tells you the strength of \n",
